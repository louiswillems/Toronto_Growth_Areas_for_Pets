Problem: A client wants to open a pet store in Toronto and has asked for advice about where it should be located.

Ideally we want to target an area that appears to be underserved currently by pet stores/services.  
To do this analysis, we will use the following information:
* the number of pets in each area in Toronto (using Forward Sortatation Areas (FSAs)) (estimated by the number of new dog/cat licenses issued per FSA)
* the neighbourhood name of each FSA (retrieved from Wikipedia)
* the popyulation of each each FSA from the 2016 census
* the foursquare api to retrieve the current number of pet stores/services per FSA

Usiing the above information, we will
* cluster neighborhoods to find areas with a relatively high number of pet licenses and low number of stores -- therefore possible candidates for a new pet store
* compare pet licenses from 2013 to 2017 to get an idea of which FSAs are showing a growth in pets -- and which are therefore also possible candidates for a new pet store
* look at the proportion of pets/population in each FSA

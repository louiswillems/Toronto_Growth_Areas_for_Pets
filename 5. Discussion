Caveats
-------
Since we don't have a way to accurately measure actual numbers of pets living in Toronto, I'm using newly issued licenses as a proxy. 
But this may not be a perfect measure since 
1) not every owner registers their pet 
2) not all pet types are registered (i.e. there could be a cluster of rabbits living in one FSA that we have no idea about!) 
3) we're really only looking at licenses issued in 2017 which doesn't cover pets registered in the past 10â€“20 years

Recommendations
---------------
My recommendation would be to target the FSAs located in Clusters 1 and 4 when looking for a location to open a new pet service/store
These areas have 
    * Low number of existing services/venues
    * Med-high number of new pet licenses issued in 2017
    * Medium to High populations
 
    
Within these clusters, 5 FSAs jump out as particularly ideal for our purposes
   cluster 4: 
      M2J (Fairview, Henry Farm, Oriole) (north west of city)
      M9V (Albion Gardens, Beaumond Heights, Humbergate, Jamestown, Mount Olive, Silverstone, South Steeles, Thistletown) (North east of city)
      M1W (L'Amoreaux West, Steeles West) (north west of city)
      M6M (Del Ray, Keelsdale, Mount Dennis, Silverthorn) (East end of city)
   cluster 1: 
      M6E (Caledonia-Fairbank) (East end of city)
      M9B (Cloverdale, Islington, Martin Grove, Princess Gardens, West Deane Park) (East end of city)

Of these, only M2J shows an increase in pets over last 5 years and may be particularly worth a closer look

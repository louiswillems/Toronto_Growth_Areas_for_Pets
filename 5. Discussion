Caveats
-------
Since we don't have a way to accurately measure actual numbers of pets living in Toronto, I'm using newly issued licenses as a proxy. 
But this may not be a perfect measure since 
1) not every owner registers their pet 
2) not all pet types are registered (i.e. there could be a cluster of rabbits living in one FSA that we have no idea about!) 
3) we're really only looking at licenses issued in 2017 which doesn't cover pets registered in the past 10â€“20 years

Recommendations
---------------
My recommendation would be to target the FSAs located in Clusters 1 and 4, particuarly these FSAs:

Of these, only M2J shows an increase in pets over last 5 years and may be particularly worth a closer look
